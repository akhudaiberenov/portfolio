# Portfolio
This repository contains mostly notebooks with objectives, that were done within studiing Data Science at Skillbox online school.
## Data analisys
- [Exploratory data analysis](https://github.com/akhudaiberenov/portfolio/blob/main/Exploratory%20data%20analysis.ipynb) of Kiva loans dataset . Kiva this is non-profit organization which allows to needy in more than 80 countries worldwide to receive funding for various types of projects and needs.
- [Analitical report for produsers of online school](https://github.com/akhudaiberenov/portfolio/blob/main/Data_analysis.ipynb]) which will help them to improve educational programms. Data is a few tables that contains information about courses, course content, progresses of students and progress phases. Calculated the potential load on teachers, to assess the expansion of the staff; evaluated the quality of the course content to identify problem modules that may need to be improved; identified potential seasonality; developed the academic performance metric for finding students which have course completion problems.
- [Analitical report with SQL](https://github.com/akhudaiberenov/portfolio/blob/main/Data%20analysis%20SQL.ipynb) for the HR department of fictional company. Complied a set of research subjects, that were tested on data. Made reccomendations for the HR department on choosing recruitment sourses and interaction with existing employees.
## Machine learning and Deep learning
- On the basis of data of telecom company developed [prediction model](https://github.com/akhudaiberenov/portfolio/blob/main/Machine%20Learning.ipynb) of outgoing clients. The model based on staking of classification ML algoritms: `k-nearest neighbors`, `decition trees` and `logistic regression`.
- [Image classifier of humans' gender, race and age](https://github.com/akhudaiberenov/portfolio/blob/main/Image%20classifier.ipynb) based on image of their faces. Performed transfer learning and finetuning of previously trained on other data model.
- [Generator of humans' faces 32x32](https://github.com/akhudaiberenov/portfolio/blob/main/Face%20generator%20(with%20GAN).ipynb) trained with `Generative adversarial network` architecture. Model generates human faces using 100 digit vector.
- [Segmentation of cat on image]()
- [Detector of handwritten digits on image]()
- [Detector of roller and disinfectant on image]()
- [Movie genre classifier](https://github.com/akhudaiberenov/portfolio/blob/main/Text%20classificator%20(RNN).ipynb), that make predictions within short rewiev of it as input.
- [Chat bot]()
- [AI model that plays in the game `Pong-v0`](). Model was trained with `Deep Q-learning` method. As input it gets mathematical substraction of 4 last images and predicts action that leads to win.
## Additional practice
- [Range detector](https://github.com/akhudaiberenov/portfolio/blob/main/range_detection.py) of barchart of any asset.
- Simple [Parser]() of posted cars for selling.
